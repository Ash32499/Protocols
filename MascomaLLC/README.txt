README

In a code text editor, such as Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/3), open the .py file for your protocol. 

Near the top of the file, locate the variable(s):

#volume of each antibody
vol = 50 #change here (in ul)

#extra voume aspirate for accuracy in multidispense
extravol = 20 #can change here (in ul)

 and change the variable(s) to the desired value(s) where there is some variation of "#change here", making sure to follow any specific directions if applicable.

Once you have changed all the necessary values, save the file and you will be ready to run your protocol per Opentrons' instructions.
