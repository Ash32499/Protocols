README

In a code text editor, such as Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/3), open the .py file for your protocol. 

Near the top of the file, locate the variable(s):

# the number of plates with 19 mm diameter wells
num19plates = 1  # change here

# the number of plates with 32 mm diameter wells
num32plates = 1 # change here

# time to create liquid flow
time = 45 # change here

and change the variable(s) to the desired value(s) where there is some variation of "#change here", making sure to follow any specific directions if applicable.

Once you have changed all the necessary values, save the file and you will be ready to run your protocol per Opentrons' instructions.
