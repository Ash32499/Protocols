README

After every run of the protocol, you will have to replace all the capsule plates with new plates and refill all of the tubes in the 2 tube racks. Please overfill them slightly, each 50ml tube needs about 51 ml for the protocol to work correctly for every capsule. The protocol runs on 8 plates at a time. Please also make sure the tip rack is reset every time as the robot starts over on the tip rack each time the protocol is run.
