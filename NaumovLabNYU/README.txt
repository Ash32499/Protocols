README

In a code text editor, such as Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/3), open the .py file for your protocol. 

Near the top of the file, locate the variable(s):

#delay time
delay = 30 #can change here

#smallest volume
small = 20 #can change here

#largest volume
large = 55 #can change here

#volume step
step = 5 #can change here

 and change the variable(s) to the desired value(s) where there is some variation of "#change here", making sure to follow any specific directions if applicable.

Once you have changed all the necessary values, save the file and you will be ready to run your protocol per Opentrons' instructions.
