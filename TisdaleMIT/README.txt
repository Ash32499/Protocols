README

In a code text editor, such as Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/3), open the .py file for your protocol. 

Near the top of the file, locate the variable(s):

#number times to mix solutions
solmix = 10 #can change here

#reagent and solutions volumes
r_vol = 295 #can change here (reagent)
x_vol = 5 #can change here (solution x)
y_vol = 5 #can change here (solution y)

and change the variable(s) to the desired value(s) where there is some variation of "#change here", making sure to follow any specific directions if applicable.

Once you have changed all the necessary values, save the file and you will be ready to run your protocol per Opentrons' instructions.
